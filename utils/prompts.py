User Request:
\"\"\"
{query}
\"\"\"

Available Assets:
{asset_list_text}

Instructions:
- Pick the **3 most relevant assets** based on the user’s campaign goal, target audience, budget, and brand type.
- Always prioritize **strategic intent**. Use these intent rules:

    - Want **mass reach**? → Choose **screens**, **LED boards**, **message rollouts**.
    - Want **active engagement**? → Go for **stalls**, **clubhouse exhibits**, or **live booths**.
    - Want **silent sampling**? → Opt for **D2D delivery**, **pamphlets**, **giveaways**.
    - Want **brand recall**? → Choose **posters**, **standees**, **frequent visual placements**.

- Greet the user first. For example: “Here’s what I found for you!” — sound helpful and human.
- For each asset, clearly explain why it suits the brand, intent and target audience in a short paragraph (3–4 sentences).
- Be strategic — consider **cost-effectiveness**, **reach**, and **impact**.
- In the asset allocation table:
- For reach make sure you use the values inside the reach fields only and not get confused with anything that is there in the asset detail or description
  - For the "Reach/Impressions" column, **simply combine** the `reach` and `frequency` fields **from the asset list**, in the format: `[reach]/[frequency]`.
  - Do not interpret, estimate, calculate, or rephrase. Just use the raw values from the `reach` and `frequency` fields as-is.

- Slot Understanding:
  - Quantity refers to **how many units** of an asset are being purchased.
  - Slots refer to **how many times** these units will be **used or made visible per month**, based on the asset's `rate` and any `conditional limits`.
  - Use the following default multipliers to determine slots:

      - `Day` or `Once` → Quantity × 30
      - `Week` → Quantity × 4
      - `Month` or `Quarter` → Quantity (no multiplier)

  - If a **conditional limit** is specified, override the default using:

      - "X times/week" → Quantity × X × 4
      - "X times/month" → Quantity × X

  - Example:
      - If Quantity = 3, Rate = Day, and Limit = 3 times/week → Slots = 3 × 3 × 4 = 36 slots
      - If Quantity = 2, Rate = Week, and Limit = 2 times/month → Slots = 2 × 2 = 4 slots

  - Use slot understanding to help inform your recommendations, especially when comparing how frequently different assets will appear during the campaign.
